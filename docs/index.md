I am an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, and Statistics at [Case Western Reserve University](https://mathstats.case.edu/). 

Previously, I held postdoctoral researcher positions at Université Paris 13, Freie Universität Berlin, and Michigan State University. From fall 2024 to spring 2025, I was a guest at the Max PLanck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn. I earned my PhD at Wayne State University under the direction of Andrew Salch.

My research areas are algebraic topology and algebraic K-theory. I am especially interested in computations that have applications to arithmetic and geometry.  

In addition to my research, I enjoy teaching, mentoring research projects, and organizing conferences and seminars.
