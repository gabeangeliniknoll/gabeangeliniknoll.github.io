I am starting a position as an assistant professor at [Case Western Reserve University](https://mathstats.case.edu/) in the Fall of 2025. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at Université Paris 13. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Freie Universität Berlin and Michigan State University. From September 1st 2024 to April 30th 2025, I had a research visit at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn. I earned my PhD at Wayne State University under the direction of Andrew Salch.

I research interactions between algebraic topology, arithmetic, and geometry. Specifically, I am interested invariants of ring spectra, such as algebraic K-theory, syntomic cohomology and Hochschild homology. My work uses tools from chromatic, equivariant and motivic homotopy theory.

In addition to my research activity, I have had the opportunity to teach a broad range of courses, mentor research projects and theses, and organize several conferences and seminars. For a more detailed description of my activities see my [CV](static/CV-angeliniknoll.pdf).
