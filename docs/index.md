I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Université Paris 13](https://www.math.univ-paris13.fr/) and I am currently on a research visit at the [Max Planck Institute for Mathematics](https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/) in Bonn. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Freie Universität Berlin and Michigan State University. I earned my PhD at Wayne State University under the direction of Andrew Salch.

I research interactions between algebraic topology, arithmetic, and geometry. Specifically, I am interested invariants of ring spectra, such as algebraic K-theory and Hochschild homology, as well as chromatic, equivariant, and motivic homotopy theory.

In addition to my research activity, I have had the opportunity to teach a broad range of courses, mentor research projects and theses, and organize several conferences and seminars. For a more detailed description of my activities see my [CV](static/CV-angeliniknoll.pdf).
