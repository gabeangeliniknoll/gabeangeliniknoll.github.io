Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin and Michigan State University. I earned my PhD at Wayne State University under the direction of Andrew Salch. I research interactions between algebraic topology, arithmetic, and geometry. Specifically, I am interested invariants of ring spectra, such as algebraic K-theory and Hochschild homology, as well as chromatic, equivariant, and motivic homotopy theory. In addition to my research activity, I have had the opportunity to teach a broad range of courses, mentor research projects and theses, and organize several conferences and seminars.
